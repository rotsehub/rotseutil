How to use?
For an object with RA and DEC coordinates known,

python fielfinder.py --ra "given RA" --dec "given DEC"

This code outputs to a csv file a list of fields that cover the objects with given coordinates.

*This is a preliminary version of the code, and it currently takes 2-3 hours to go through entire ROTSE III-b data - from 2003-2015. More updates coming soon...
